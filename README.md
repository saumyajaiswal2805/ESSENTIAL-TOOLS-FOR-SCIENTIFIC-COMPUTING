# 4. Implementing a back propagation neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer in Python programming language. We are using only the NumPy library. No other library functions are used for the implementation.

Making our implementation flexible so that the user will input the learning rate, the number of neurons in the input, and the output layer. Number of hidden layers will be one of the following (taken as user input). The initial weights would be assigned with random numbers.

Training the model for 1000 epochs with the “Boston Housing” dataset,
testing on the same, and report the accuracy/loss for the following cases. 

(a) Number of neurons in hidden layer = 3, learning rate = 0.01

(b) Number of neurons in hidden layer = 4, learning rate = 0.001

(c) Number of neurons in hidden layer = 5, learning rate = 0.0001 

Using five and ten-fold cross validation for this purpose.
